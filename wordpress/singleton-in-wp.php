//Now, you have created a simple WordPress plugin using the Singleton design pattern. The My_Plugin class represents your plugin, and the get_instance() method is responsible for creating and returning the instance of the class. The my_plugin() function acts as a shortcut to retrieve the instance of the plugin class.

//You can now activate your plugin in the WordPress admin dashboard, and you will have a single instance of your plugin class that can be accessed globally throughout your WordPress installation.

//Please note that the code provided above demonstrates a basic implementation of the Singleton pattern in WordPress. Depending on your specific requirements, you may need to modify and expand upon this code to suit your needs.
